# 🎨 For Artists

Visual artists have made a major leap in the past several years by being able to integrate their art into the blockchain, birthing NFTs. We want NewPangea to be a place where artists can network with other artists, developers/engineers, and their audience to continue to elevate their creations. Artists are encouraged to help us build the metaverse and each district, create and showcase their own art, or collaborate with others to elevate the worth and importance of art and inspiration  in the current technology and art renaissance. &#x20;
