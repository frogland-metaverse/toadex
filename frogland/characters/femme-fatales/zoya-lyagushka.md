My name is Zoya
I grew up on a chicken farm
in the middle of nothing and nowhere.

our chickens were too tough to be eaten.
so we trained them.
most were fighters…
some were killers…
the most expensive ones: 
…assassins.

my name is Zoya
I was adopted by
a young, peace-loving couple in the north  [ ask ant about specific area on map ]
they are salamanders, my parents.

when I am eighteen a frog swat team broke down our door
they took my parents — “Spies”, they said.
they bring me to Frogland, telling me: “Welcome to your new life.”

…and then I am alone…

my name is Zoya.
I am an orphan.
my parents were salamanders
but they weren’t spies.
I am a Frog who lives in Frogland.
I still train chickens.
…it is one of my most lucrative income streams.
I sell fighters who will lose.
I sell killers who will win.
But the assassins — these I keep.

my name is Zoya.
I have many lives.
In this life, I live for revenge.
