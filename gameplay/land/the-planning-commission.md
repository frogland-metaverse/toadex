# The Planning Commission

Planning Commissions might be among the most notorious organizations in the land of the Notorious Frogs, or at least among the most degenerate. Planning Commissions in Frogland are inherently and verifiably corrupt, and i_nteractions with the Planning Commission can and will involve chance mechanics and volitional acts of bribery_. Players can attempt to bribe and influence a Planning Commission, and, furthermore, players can collectivize their interaction with a Planning Commission through the use of _Syndicates_. This collective approach is one example of how the foundational design of Frogland accounts for a need to enable individuals and small groups to organize in ways that make it possible to compete with individual whales who otherwise could game the system based on an ability to control supply.

## What Is The Planning Commission?

A Planning Commission is a corrupt, unelected bureaucracy in Frogland. There are multiple Planning Commissions in the world. Each one manages functions that pertain to the plot of land’s specific type (coastal, forest, wetland, etc). Think of each Planning Commission as an overseer of different ecological zones. So, Planning Commissions have an effect not only on the issuance of land improvement permits, they also have influence on the ownership transfer processes of the land they oversee.

It oversees various functions including the attachment of a Land Deed to a specific LilyPAD within one of several, specific biomes. Bribes are also segmented along these lines, with each biome’s Planning Commission office managing the occupancy applications within its territories. The Planning Commission is verifiably corrupt, accepting bribes in the form of resource tokens in exchange for moving up the queue to assign a Deed to a different lilyPAD, to get a work Permit, or both.

An important detail is that the Land Location is decoupled from the Deed. That decoupling allows for the Land Deed to change physical location. Moving to a new place is a fundamental mechanic, and the underlying design has to allow for that maneuver.

It’s also true that many will be perfectly fine with where their Land lands, and so, when looking at the traits of that land can look at the challenge as, “Well, this is what I got, so how can I work to get the most out of it?” Our answer is to make a process available that allows a Frog to maximize resource token harvesting on whatever land they have via improvements.

The Planning Commission will serve other similar functions in Frogland as the economy, ecosystem, and gameplay progress. Some interactions will be reserved for individual players, such as resource extraction permitting, where other more competitive interactions will be reserved for Syndicates, where cooperation with others will be necessary to gain any advantage over the majority.&#x20;

## Why The Planning Commission?&#x20;

The Planning Commission has multiple objectives for the gameplay and economic mechanics in Frogland. It introduces the means by which players may take certain actions, and gamifies those actions by introducing competitive elements.

The Planning Commission also acts as a deflationary lever to drain liquidity out of the Frogland economy, driving resource scarcity. It furthermore acts as a source of randomness in Frogland, introducing surprise and unpredictability of outcomes to gameplay, for the purposes of both fun and fairness.

For a very simplified example - think of the free parking space in Monopoly. It could be the thing that pulls someone from the brink of loss back into the game in a leader position…but only if played in the way where the reward for landing on that space has a treasury from the fines and taxes paid from the Chance and Community Chest cards. These fines and taxes make their way into Frogland as bribery of the most notorious kind.

## Bribery and Other Totally Legitimate Gameplay Mechanics&#x20;

There is no fun in a game where initial winners dominate via a cascade effect based upon being there first. If initial winners keep winning more easily than newcomers, and newcomers are left further and further behind, that kills opportunity, and therefore kills the fun.

The Planning Commission is a gameplay entity whose mechanics and rules will be designed such that “early entry” advantage is modulated by a randomness that enables each Land Holder a reasonable chance to succeed even on their first day in the world. Fresh meat can catch up, and the veterans may lose ground.

Those who possess more Frogs or Deeds may appear to have a superior advantage at first glance. But that apparent advantage is balanced by the inherent difficulty they will have managing many characters and lilyPADs. Maximizing resource harvesting can be more complex and time consuming for a Don than for a citizen with only one to manage.

Interactions with the Planning Commission have a cost. You can wait in line and pay the standard fee, or dig deep and offer a bribe to jump the queue.

The standard fee may change from time to time. The bribery amount is also variable, and will depend on the specific Planning Commission's peculiarities. Some want more money, some may want…other stuff you can offer, or tasks you might be able to complete. Criss-Cross. You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours.

The Planning Commission is a monopoly, and like all monopolies it is inherently, notoriously, verifiably corrupt. Commissioners — whether a Frog or a stream of code logic — can and will deviate from their Oath of Office. They can and will hoodwink the powers that be to trust them. And so maybe you shouldn’t. The rules are always made so winners stay winners and losers become lost. Buyer beware. But remember: if you’re corrupt, and your target isn’t, things can go down bad. On one hand: Trust, but Verify. On the other: fuck it, why not roll the dice.

## Safety In Numbers&#x20;

The Planning Commission has one predictable pattern: it will give Syndicates and Syndicate members priority in exchange for bribes. This means your chances of getting what you want from a Planning Commission improves if you are not a singleton, but a member of a group.

Bribes are competitive. More money is more attractive to a bribable entity or character MOST times, but other factors can affect which bribes a Planning Commission may accept. What the Forest Planning Commission may think is a valuable bribe might not match with what the Desert Planning Commission might desire, and this should be taken into account when determining the bribe type, amount, and specificity of tokens offered. When a bribe is accepted by a Planning Commission, you will jump the queue - if declined, your bribe will be returned, and you’ll have to wait in line, remove your belt and your shoes, and make sure to separate your laptop from your carryon.
