# The Notorious Frogs' Origin Story

A plague had turned Earth’s frogs immortal at the cost of sapping all their energy, condemning them to having no fun whatsoever, for eternity — they called the plague “The UnderToad, Destroyer of Funk”.  Until one day they discover a dead extra-terrestrial slumped against one of their trees, a pair of dark goggles in its strange hand.&#x20;

One by one they look into the goggles and are sucked into a new world — a metaverse they call NewPangea, where they now live high on a plateau — a wellspring of all water and life for the supercontinent. There are remnants of some kind of alien species that had been living on NewPangea, appearing to have been abandoned in a rush and then left to fall into a state of disrepair.&#x20;

They find their froggy selves transformed into a hybrid of amphibian and humanoid alien and their physical energy is through the roof. Their pent-up energies unleashed, they sing together, bumping booty. They cosplay, party all the time, and push every experience to its edge until their debauchery gives rise to a collective will to become Notorious and rule the metaverse.&#x20;

How notorious will your frog be...and become?&#x20;
