# Map Quest Commands

The Frogland Map Quest was a scavenger hunt style quest in the discord where Froghodlrs searched for the 38 missing map pieces stolen from Shrimp and Bugs by Slimy Salamanders from the north.

## SPOILERS BELOW THIS POINT

The map pieces were torn asunder during the tumultuous events of that fateful evening, and the salamanders scurried off with them. As the Slimy Salamanders departed, there was a veritable stampede all the way through town leaving a trail of splooge behind them. One lucky frog caught sight of a bedraggled map piece nearly obscured in a puddle of sludge, giving them some kind of hint about what they should be looking for.&#x20;

Desperately, the more clever frogs began to query the Unkown Magicks (bot) of Frogland, trying to "$trap-salamander" and "$chase-salamander". After finally succeeding and acquiring another map piece, the hunt was on! All kinds of commands were flung like prayers skyward to Unkown Magicks, hoping that one (or 36) would work and bless them with another map piece.&#x20;

As they continued their efforts, a few clever frogs thought about how the first map piece had been found left after the Slimy Salamander stampede through town. After some thought, they started to lurk in side alleys all across town waiting for another Salamander stampede, hoping that their luck would hold and an unwitting Salamander might again drop another piece of the map.&#x20;

After some time, these frogs got quite adept at ambushing the Salamanders and stealing map pieces back - so much so that they ended up catching the same Slimy Salamanders several times, but without a new piece of map for their troubles! Stumped, the frogs went back to the drawing board.&#x20;

Calling upon one of the pieces of alien technology left behind from Frogland's previous inhabitants, they began to ask "$ok-froggle" for help. As they were just beginning to unravel the mysteries of this device, the going was tough. Getting the phrasing _exactly_ right was more challenging than anticipated, leaving many cursing Froggle, Salamanders, and even the OverToad.&#x20;

At last, they struck gold and started looking into where the evidence from the kerfuffle was being kept. The Frogland Police Department was far to slow to get to the scene on the same day, so the Frogland Bureau of Instigations took lead on the investigation. However, there seemed to be something fishy going on. The FBI had claimed to have recovered one piece of the map from the crime scene, and yet...

There seemed to be a lot more than just the single original piece that was discovered. With this direction, the frogs began looking at the FBI and their agents for the rest of the map pieces, and even had to fight their way through several raids. Finally, they managed to secure all the map pieces and repair the map. After getting them put back together, the final product of the Frogland map looks significantly better than either the Slimy Salamanders or the FBI agents when our Cartographers were through with them!
