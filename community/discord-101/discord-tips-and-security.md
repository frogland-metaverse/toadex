# ðŸ”’ Discord Tips & Security

{% hint style="info" %}
Discord is a communication platform usually used by gamers to chat to each other while playing. With the rise of web3, Discord has found more uses: NFT projects typically open a server for their community members where they can communicate between the team, community, and others in a single location. Check out this link from Discord for more information on [getting started](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started).
{% endhint %}

## **PRIVACY/SAFETY SETTINGS IN DISCORD**

Direct Messaging: **Set to (Safe)**&#x20;

Allow Direct Messages From Server Members: **(OFF)**

Who can add you as friend, everyone? **(OFF)**&#x20;

Verify phone number and email: **(2 Factor Authentication, from App Store)**&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### IF YOU JOIN [FROGLAND'S DISCORD](https://discord.gg/frogland) AND DO NOT **IMMEDIATELY VERIFY**, YOU **WILL** BE KICKED OUT OF THE SERVER.

DM Lollihops on discord or twitter, or the Frogland twitter account if you're having trouble.
{% endhint %}

## **BEST PRACTICES**&#x20;

**Never** share passwords or seed phrase/secret recovery phrase&#x20;

**Never** respond to DMs from someone you donâ€™t know&#x20;

**Never** click links, images, or videos sent to you&#x20;

**Never** sign into Discord or crypto wallets sent through a link&#x20;

**Never** send screenshots or screen share in DMs&#x20;

IF YOU NEED TO SCREEN SHARE, go into your Discord settings and enable Streamer Mode (User Settings > Streamer Mode > Enable). This will help protect your identity while streaming your Discord screen ONLY.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
### REMEMBER

The server owners/admins/mods will **never** DM you first&#x20;

A project/server **cannot** DM you - only users can DM&#x20;

If you're not certain about the veracity of a user, check their user ID with the Mod Squad or Frog Team members in a public channel, like in #help-and-questions
