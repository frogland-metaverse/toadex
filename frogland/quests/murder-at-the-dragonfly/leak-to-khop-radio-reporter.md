# Leak to KHOP Radio Reporter

You are up late one night listening to the police scanner. It’s past 2a and you’ve had a nip of frog grog so you’re just a little foggy. You think you hear something interesting on the scanner, and turn up the volume…

“Officer…(inaudible)…calling for backup. Received a call from the crime tip line…anon…caller with a tip…(inaudible)…early this evening. Two officers…reported to the scene…DOA.”

“Officer, this is dispatch. Your line is breaking up. What is your location?”

“Repeat…dead on arrival. Anonymous tip…(inaudible)…officer requesting backup. Dispatch, do you copy?”

“Copy officer, DOA. What is your location?”

“(Inaudible)…woods outside town. Southwest side, near…(inaudible)…Osseous.”

“Copy that. Officers and medical en route to your location. Hold your position.”

“Dispatch, I know this sounds crazy…(inaudible)…Jimmy the Knee.”

“Officer, repeat your last?”

“Jimmy Grenouille, it’s…The Knee.”

“Jimmy the Knee? Officer, repeat?”

“It’s him, it’s Jimmy’s body…again.”

“Officer, hold position. Backup is 2 minutes out. Sending an officer to the morgue to confirm. Stand by.”

The scanner goes quiet. You sit in silence, shocked. What will Frogland make of this?
