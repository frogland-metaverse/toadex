# All Chill, No Shill

#### Calling all: Builders - Misfits - Geeks - Creatives - Artists - Developers

We seek to be interesting without hype, to be passionate but not polarizing. We do it for those who want to go deeper - no shilling, no elevator pitches. Just conversations from unexpected places with an emphasis on creativity and the passion behind web3.

We discuss the origins, the philosophy, and the journey that brought these folks into the space. Interviewing the founders, builders, and creatives fueling this renaissance.&#x20;
