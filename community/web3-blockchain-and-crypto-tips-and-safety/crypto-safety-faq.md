# ‚ùì Crypto Safety FAQ

**Question:** If I connected to a potentially malicious site, is it possible that my wallet was compromised without me signing anything?
{% endhint %}

**Short Answer**\
You should be fine, but I would get a ledger anyway.

**Long Answer**\
Whether using MetaMask or a Ledger connected to MetaMask, simply by "connecting" to a site without signing anything does not make it possible to steal your seed phrase, and it is not possible for the website to unlock your wallet.&#x20;

_**It is possible for a scam site to compromise your wallet in other ways though, even if you didn't sign a transaction.**_

**Question**: How do I move my NFTs from MetaMask to a hardware wallet?
{% endhint %}

1. Get a Ledger hardware wallet and set it up. Only purchase it from the manufacturer, and never use one where the box has been opened.&#x20;
2. Write down your seed phrase with pen and paper (not in your notes app, not in an email, don't take a picture of it, not in your LastPass) and NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER enter it into a computer _anywhere_. Only enter it onto the Ledger hardware directly.
3. Follow the instructions to connect it to MetaMask and you'll get a new public wallet address
4. If your NFTs and crypto are in a regular MetaMask account (no Ledger) you will have to transfer your assets by sending them to the new address attached to the Ledger.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do NOT enter the MetaMask seed phrase into the Ledger and think that's good enough. It isn't. Always follow step #1.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you are in a situation where you have been using MetaMask for a while and want to move to a Ledger, **you WILL have to transfer**. I know, it sucks. Just wait till gas is low (2am Saturday morning East coast US time is usually the low point of the week).
