My name is Zoya<br>
I grew up on a chicken farm<br>
in the middle of nothing and nowhere.<br>
<br>
our chickens were too tough to be eaten.<br>
so we trained them.<br>
most were fighters…<br>
some were killers…<br>
the most expensive ones: <br>
…assassins.
<br>
my name is Zoya<br>
I was adopted by<br>
a young, peace-loving couple in the north <br>
they are salamanders, my parents.<br>
<br>
when I am eighteen a frog swat team broke down our door<br>
they took my parents — “Spies”, they said.<br>
they bring me to Frogland, telling me: “Welcome to your new life.”<br>
<br>
…and then I am alone…<br>
<br>
my name is Zoya.<br>
I am an orphan.<br>
my parents were salamanders<br>
but they weren’t spies.<br>
I am a Frog who lives in Frogland.<br>
I still train chickens.<br>
…it is one of my most lucrative income streams.<br>
I sell fighters who will lose.<br>
I sell killers who will win.<br>
But the assassins — these I keep.<br>
<br>
my name is Zoya.<br>
I have many lives.<br>
In this life, I live for revenge.<br>
[eats fly that passes by]
