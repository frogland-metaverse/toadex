# ü•∏ Syndicates

The syndicates are the natural progression of gangs with interests beyond the social layer. Traditionally, these are called ‚Äòguilds‚Äô in other Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORGs). A syndicate is formed by successfully progressing through the gang‚Äôs FRPG storyline, then working with the Frog Team to define what exactly the syndicate‚Äôs area of interest is. In the present and near future, this includes how they can help develop and create the game and world ‚Äî but in the further future it will also have gameplay mechanics similar to the Planning Commission.

For example, the Nazar Frogs, HipHOP Anonymous, and the Magic Guild began as gangs but have progressed through their storyline such that they now have their own syndicate, or are in the process of formalizing one. The Nazar Frogs make up their social layer, while the Aquatica Casino is run by their syndicate, managing the in-game gambling and assisting with the economic balance of the world. The HipHOP Anonymous Gang has launched their syndicate of Sapo Studios, a music production studio offering their services to community members in Frogland and IRL. Similarly, the Magic Guild‚Äôs syndicate is currently developing the crafting and magical mechanics of the gameplay alongside the Frog Team.

These are just a few examples of gangs and their syndicates and how they can be utilized not only to build out Frogland, but to develop beyond the simple 10k membership package of the Notorious Frogs, and get involved on a much deeper level.

### Internal Structure of a Syndicate

Gang and syndicate memberships are not mutually exclusive or inclusive. Users can join as many gangs as they would like, or none. Being a member of one gang does not mean that you have to be a member of that syndicate, or preclude you from supporting another syndicate.

Gangs are social and a ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù way to play. Syndicates will have a ‚Äòfounding team‚Äô that will work with the Frog Team to denote their internal operational structure, such as a council or DAO system, and will accept pledges for membership. Syndicate members receive more of a formalized benefit structure for being a member than a gang member might, but also require a standardized offering or entry fee to receive these benefits. The benefits and pledges required will be determined by each syndicate and the Frog Team, and disclosed as we progress in development.

### **Pledging to a Syndicate** <a href="#5f5a" id="5f5a"></a>

Syndicate membership is limited by how many Frogs and/or lilyPADs you own ‚Äî one pledge per land or Frog NFT. The membership fee required by a syndicate is up to that syndicate‚Äôs internal organizational structures to determine. There could be no fee ‚Äî free to join ‚Äî a donation style fee, a creative contribution request, an amount of resources, or a token based fee.

By harvesting the resources from your Frog or lilyPAD, the player will have a certain amount of resources to trade or pledge directly to a syndicate for benefits specific to that syndicate. Some amount of the resources gathered from each will make up your membership fee to a syndicate. However, the pledges are not necessarily fixed, nor necessarily token or resource based ‚Äî it could be a creative contribution that your syndicate requires for membership, like producing beats or stems for Sapo Studios. Pledges may be accepted in the form of raw resources, a liquidity pool token, or a mixture of both. A syndicate could also offer free membership, or a ‚Äúgive what you can‚Äô‚Äô donation based membership.

Pledging will occur on a regular basis to allow for a shift of memberships depending on current needs of players. Pledging will likely start at the beginning of each season, but will possibly occur more frequently than that.

### **Bribing With A Syndicate** <a href="#5eb8" id="5eb8"></a>

Syndicates, as larger groups, have more power and resources available for bribery. As such, a benefit for members could be bribing a Planning Commission, or other similar entity, for priority treatment for their members. This will help balance the scales so users with only one Frog still have the opportunity to bribe their way to the front of the lines as a benefit of pledging some resources to a syndicate, and not be overrun by those with huge tracts of land and an army of Frogs.
