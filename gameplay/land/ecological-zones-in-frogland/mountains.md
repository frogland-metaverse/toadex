# Mountains

![A real estate billboard for the Mountains biome in Frogland. ](https://imgur.com/GSVIROV.jpg)

Ahhh...the mountains! This concept art image of the mountain biomes is personally one of my favorites to show off the intended art style of the land. From further away the colors and shading really gives it a significant amount of depth and texture, and as you get closer, you start to realize how much of that is more abstract than photorealistic to create the depth. As a great contrast, the boats on the water below are much further away, but their lines are much more crisp and clean, showing the subject very clearly despite the distance. This effect helps give the viewer a sense of great detail, depth, and texture in the image without losing the sense of distance by going too abstract, as well as reducing the rendering load by not over-detailing the closer, more complex foreground of the rock face.

More info coming soon...
