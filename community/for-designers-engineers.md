# ⌨ For Designers/Engineers

Historically, there have been projects that have been very highly anticipated that were released and looked nothing like what the community expected, leading to huge disappointment. There have also been community built projects that have grown into a disorganized cacophony where nothing can be built. The difference with NewPangea is that we are doing both. We are very community forward with design, narrative, utility, as well as being transparent through the entire process of development about what is doable, feasible, and impossible. So the question really is...what do you want _your_ NewPangea to look like?
