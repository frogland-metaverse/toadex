# Giovanni "Giovo" Raft

Never known by his full formal name of Giovanni, Giovo Raft moonlighted with the stage name 'Golden Jo' as a drag queen with a reputation for classic but flamboyant dance routines. Rumored to have had his heart broken by a certain Michigan J. Frog before abandoning the sequin studded lifestyle, he has ruled over Frogland for the past thirteen terms (or at least as long as most frogs care to remember), and refuses to answer when called by his previous stage name - but his closest associates call him "Gio", pronounced "Jo".
