# üèù Biomes of Frogland

## The Seven Different Biomes of Frogland

Residential land is zoned according to different criteria, the most important of which are its ecological domain: the aggregate of its terrain, plant life, animal habitat, and any inorganic items available in that zone type. Each plot of land exists in an ecology that is important for the three pillars of the NewPangea experience: _‚ÄòAdventure in a Quirky World‚Äô, ‚ÄòCommunity and Socially Driven‚Äô, and ‚ÄòTokenomics and Trading‚Äô_**.** Ensuring the balance of questing, resource acquisition, resource farming, and social interaction is cohesively and deeply interlinked is paramount for the success of the metaverse.

Each ecology has unique combinations of both organic and in-organic resources, like minerals. Each is statistically balanced alongside the others, such that the distinct advantages of each Ecological Zone or biome will impact and will be impacted by the surrounding zones. Further, the ecological and economic dynamics inherent in the zones are designed specifically to amplify the economic, social, and adventure design that encourages and gamifies the participation by those in Frogland, or in any district of NewPangea. The primary ecological zones are comprised of the following:
