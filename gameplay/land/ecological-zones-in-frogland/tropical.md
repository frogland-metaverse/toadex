# ðŸŒ´ Tropical

![A real estate billboard for the Tropical biome in Frogland. ](https://imgur.com/6b138pS.jpg)

This biome was named 'grasslands' to start, but Frogs tend to lean towards more humidity and wetness in the overall climate than arid, dry areas. More of a tropical look began to emerge with strange flora as a stark contrast against proud mountains in the backdrop, leading to what you see here in the concept art. The types of resources available will vary with each biome as well as fluctuating with the seasons - so consider not only which biome is the most visually appealing to you, but also consider what may be available for harvest and the gameplay and how that fits into your frog's life, character, and lore. Personally, this is one of my favorites. I love the lush and abundant strange life forms - plant or otherwise!!
