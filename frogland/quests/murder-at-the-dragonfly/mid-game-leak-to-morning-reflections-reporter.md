# Leak to Morning Reflections Reporter

You’re sitting at home, curled up with a good book having a lovely nightcap in your slippers, ready to tuck in, when your phone rings. You almost consider letting it ring through, but sigh and hop up to answer it. The voice of your contact at the FLPD rings shrilly through the line, slicing through the warm, sleepy haze of your last glass of Lotus Flower Wine.

“Hey there Missy, hope I didn’t wake you. Got some info that we need you to get published for us.”

You sigh, and head over to your typewriter. Whatever this is clearly can’t wait until the morning, which means another late night for you and a publisher who won’t be happy to hear from you in the hour it’ll take you to write this up. “Why can’t criminals commit their crimes during normal working hours? I know, I know...go ahead when you’re ready.”

“Well...it’s a little bit of an odd one. We don’t want to panic the public, so we are trying to keep some details quiet.”

You perk up, your reporter senses making your vestigial tail wiggle in anticipation. Maybe this will be the clue you need to crack this case, prove that top tier reporting is the only reputable way to go about delicate issues like these. “Go on…” you prompt.

“Like I said...we need some details to stay quiet. So, on the record...an officer was responding to an anonymous tip from our crime hotline, responded to the location of the report, south side of town in the woods, and confirmed the report of a dead body.”

Another one? Your eyes widen as you start scribbling notes furiously.

“We need you to ask the public if they have any further details, missing frogs reports, any notorious activity that they want to report...you know, the usual. Now...off the record. I need your word, Missy!”

Your mind racing, you agree while also working to find a loophole in the promise you’ve just made.

“The dead body...well, if it’s not Jimmy Grenouille, it’s his twin brother. And we both know he doesn’t have a twin.”

Your pen stills, too shocked to even answer.

“Now I know it sounds crazy, and if you even think about putting me on the record as saying that before the Frogland coroner has a chance to ID the body…again…this working relationship we have here is through. But I swear to you, Missy...that was the fresh body of Jimmy Grenouille. No idea how. No idea why. But it was.” Silence stretches as your mind races. “I’ll leave you to it... remember what is ON record and what is OFF. Goodnight.”

You are less convinced of your intent to stay loyal to that promise, but your thoughts outpace your fingers as they fly over the keys on your typewriter. What new information will come to light as the sun rises over the cattails, you wonder...Frogland never disappoints.
