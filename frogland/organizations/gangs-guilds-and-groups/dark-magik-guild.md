# Dark Magik Guild

As the magical trials in the Magik Guild become more and more difficult, some frogs become extremely frustrated. A small portion of them walk away from their lessons, content with what they have learned, to pursue other endeavors. Others start to hear voices inside their heads…

“This is not your destiny”&#x20;

“Why bow to these weaklings?”&#x20;

“They dont care about you”&#x20;

“Feed the anger, it is the only path to true power”&#x20;

“Do not hold back”&#x20;

“Why should you care what they think?”&#x20;

“They’re holding you back”

All of the frogs approach the high counsel with questions concerning the voices that they are hearing. The counsel tells them that magic has two sides, like a coin. There is positive “clean” energy, and there is dark, tainted magic that feeds off of negativity and consumes the souls of all that decide to touch it.

The high council tells them that merely hearing the voices shows them that some of the frogs may not be suited to continue their training and that they must all submit to a test of heart. The counsel has each frog place his hand upon the magic stone one at a time. The frogs are instructed to think back upon their strongest memories as they do this.

The stone begins to glow and the frog touching it at the time is transported to a chamber that he has never seen…

The room is empty except for two doors, side by side, and an owl, that seems to be on fire, sitting between them upon a perch. The owl speaks and asks the frog a series of questions…



**Do you believe in Frod?**

Yes, I am a true believer&#x20;

No, I don't believe in frog tales&#x20;



**Do you believe that there are consequences to your actions?**

Yes, one receives what one earns (good or bad)&#x20;

No, I control my own destiny&#x20;



**Would you ever sacrifice yourself to help or save another?**&#x20;

Yes, sacrifice is the key to the Heavens&#x20;

No, other frogs problems are their own not mine&#x20;



**If given the choice would you choose a life of power or humility?**&#x20;

Humility, power corrupts the soul&#x20;

Power, humility is for the weak&#x20;



**Are you willing to commit your life to the betterment of others?**&#x20;

Yes…&#x20;

Only if it suits my objectives



Upon listening to the frogs answers, the fiery owl flaps his wings and one of the doors behind him opens. He gestures the frog through, and a half frog/half goat creature leads you to a mirror portal.

A frog of pure heart walks through the door to see that he is once again standing in front of the High Council. “Your heart is pure. Your training may proceed.”

A frog that has given selfish and self-serving answers enters the door to find himself standing in front of a group of frogs that he has never seen before. They are sitting upon thrones that seem to be made of the skeletons of creatures that he has never encountered. A pale, cold looking frog with a wicked grin upon his face, and a forked tongue, motions the frog to come forth and kneel. “I see that we have one that may have what it takes to know the true meaning of the word POWER,” he says.

Welcome to the Dark Magik Guild… Your training has just begun….
