# Levels & Affiliations

## **Affiliations** <a href="#bf6c" id="bf6c"></a>

Levels and Affiliations can be considered a baseline for where your character starts when entering into Frogland. Affiliations do not limit a Frog to a certain path - they **** could be your frog’s past occupation, present, or even future.&#x20;

## Levels

Levels from 1–8 are below average, 9–14 are average, and 15–20 are above average. **** Levels can be improved upon or degraded depending on gameplay. Boosts and the Essence they emit may even be used to highlight some natural Levels of the Frogs.&#x20;
