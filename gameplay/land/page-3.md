# Bribing The Planning Commission

Interactions with the Planning Commission have a cost. You can wait in line and pay the standard fee, or dig deep and [offer a bribe](page-3.md) to jump the queue. The standard fee may change from time to time.

Size matters — but it’s not the only thing. Cultivating a bribe to the needs of a specific Planning Commission increases the likelihood of acceptance, just like bringing your friends to the party. [Bribes from a Syndicate](the-planning-commission/syndicate-bribes-for-the-planning-commission.md) are bigger and more impressive than an individual’s, and more likely to be accepted, not returned.

The bribery amount is also variable, and will depend on the specific Planning Commission's peculiarities. Some want more money, some may want…other stuff you can offer, or tasks you might be able to complete. [Criss-Cross](https://youtu.be/lqqspC4Sf50). You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours.

The Planning Commission is a monopoly, and like all monopolies it is inherently, notoriously, verifiably corrupt. Commissioners — whether a Frog or a stream of code logic — can and will deviate from their Oath of Office. They can and will hoodwink the powers that be to trust them. And so maybe you shouldn’t. The rules are always made so winners stay winners and losers become lost. Buyer beware. But remember: if you’re corrupt, and your target isn’t, things can go down bad. On one hand: trust, but verify. On the other: fuck it, why not roll the dice.
