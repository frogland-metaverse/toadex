# ðŸ–¼ Non-Fungible Tokens

The first four NFTs that will be kicking off our journey into the metaverse are: the Notorious Frogs, the LilyPADs, the Land Deeds, and the Permits.&#x20;

The Frogs and the Land Deeds are individually tradable assets, whereas the Land is tied to the Land Deed _until_ it is reassigned by interacting with the _Planning Commission_. Similarly, the _Permits_ will be tied to the Land for a set duration of time, just as real resources vary with seasons of the year (note that a â€˜yearâ€™ in Frogland is not necessarily identical to an IRL year).
