### **$deposit \[all or amount]** _OR_ **$dep \[all or amount]**

This will deposit your cash into your bank account.

### **$withdraw \[all or amount]** _OR_ **$with \[all or amount]**&#x20;

This will withdraw cash from your bank account.&#x20;

### **$give \[username] \[all or amount]**

If you say $give \[username] all, it will only give that user all of the cash you have on hand - not what you have in your bank account.&#x20;

### **$leaderboard** _OR_ **$lb**
