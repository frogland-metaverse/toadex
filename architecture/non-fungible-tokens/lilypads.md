The Land plots will have their own sets of traits, stats, and rarity. A plot of land can be on one of several ecological zones, such as coastal, grassland, wetland, mountains, forest, desert, metropolitan. The land’s zone type implies a dominant resource based on the ecology of its zone, but resources from other zones may also be present.

The resources of each plot of Land determine the tokens that land will generate. Further, seasonal changes re-roll those resources per season in a way that utilizes randomness but that is based upon the land’s ecological zone, and based upon the land’s detailed traits, stats, and rarity.

For any given season the resources for each land plot is fixed and finite. Meaning: during any given season a land plot’s resources can be depleted if fully harvested. In such a case the land holder would have to wait for the next season, when the re-roll of resource allocation will determine the abundance available to be harvested as tokens during that new season. Alternatively, a Frog could interact with the Planning Commission mid-season to move to another plot of land that has not been depleted of its resources.

For anyone looking to maximize their token gain, owning a Notorious Frog in addition to the Land offers statistical advantage, because the MAX token harvest from land can only happen if a Notorious Frog’s interaction with the land is factored in. In other words, maximal benefit from the land requires both having a Frog occupant and “working” that land. However, it’s also true that the statistical resource advantage from being a Frog doesn’t guarantee that a frogless holder is excluded from having stats that might give them a very high yield. Superior gain is less likely but not impossible for a land deed held by the frogless.
