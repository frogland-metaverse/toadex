# üèî New Froghodlr's Guide: Land Edition

### The "Wait - Buy Frog, Get Land?" Checklist

* [ ] Check your frog's land claim status at [our website](https://frogland.io/mint) or using the [Rareboy](https://rareboy.com/) extension
* [ ] If unclaimed, CLAIM!! Or don't - it's up to you! Claim will stay open until all frogs have claimed their land.&#x20;
* [ ] Read up on the [lore of the Land Synthesis Devices](../../frogland/lore/canon/the-land-synthesis-device-and-our-forgotten-past.md)
* [ ] Learn how your LSD represents [land ownership](../../gameplay/land/land-deeds.md) and [much](../../architecture/non-fungible-tokens/lilypads.md), much more

We have a plethora of both narrative and tech based literature out about both the [Land Devices](https://medium.com/@frogland/the-land-synthesis-device-and-our-forgotten-past-88e74921dbe8), [Land Mechanics](https://frogland.medium.com/property-mechanics-in-newpangea-522e4c1b2e1e), and the value of [holding your Frogs](https://frogland.medium.com/notorious-frogs-the-essence-of-frogland-afbf7c64781f) after the land claim. There is also a significant amount of content worth going through in our white paper ([The Toadex](https://frogland.gitbook.io/toadex/)) including a section on gameplay interactions, on the current NFTs in the Frogland ecosystem, how they interact in game, and the blockchain integrations.

Part of that reading includes the development of the ‚Äòland deeds‚Äô concept early this year, and how it has evolved to be more fitting with the narrative of the Notorious Frogs into its current state.

_**The Land Device is the product of wanting more from virtual land than just proof of ownership (like a land deed) and the ability to buy and sell - this is the way in which you will maintain ownership in the ecosystem while shifting your ownership to a different land plot, the way you'll interact with your land, harvest resources, encrypt and decrypt messages, interface with magicks, and much, MUCH more.**_&#x20;
{% endhint %}

It is a small glimpse into the future. Built into a wild piece of alien technology adapted by the Frogs, there lies endless options for verifiable updatability, adjustment, puzzles, and fun ‚Äî all while also functioning as a land deed to the lilyPAD you own in Frogland.

### #BuyFrogGetLand was never the end game‚Äî it is just the beginning.

All hodlrs of a Notorious Frog will be able to go to our official [website](https://frogland.io/) and proceed with your claim. It‚Äôs very easy: connect your wallet via MetaMask, sign the Terms of Service (TOS) **gas-less** transaction, choose the number you want to claim, then hit the ‚ÄúClaim‚Äù button! You can also claim your frogs with a **batch claim to help reduce gas** ‚Äî just make sure your frogs are all in the same wallet.

**There is no rush to claim ‚Äî claim whenever is convenient for you.** The claim will open and remain open until all frogs have claimed their lilyPADs ‚Äî so no gas wars! This also means that there is the option for those savvy snipers to hop onto our website to check the claim status of a frog available on the secondary before purchasing, and thus being able to claim _moar free land_!

{% hint style="success" %}
_**IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO SEE IF A FROG FOR SALE HAS HAD THEIR LAND CLAIMED ALREADY OR NOT,** hop over to our website_ [_https://frogland.io_](https://frogland.io)_, connect your wallet in the upper right hand corner, then type the token ID into the ‚ÄúNo Good Deeds‚Äù section on the website._
{% endhint %}

**The Land Devices that are claimed by Frogs will have token IDs from 1‚Äì10k**, so there will be a clear differentiator (or two‚Ä¶) between those Land Devices that have been claimed vs those that have been minted. The minted Land Devices will start at 10,001 and go up from there.

The **rarity of the Frogs has no impact** on the rarity of the Land Devices or lilyPADs themselves. The assignment of plot numbers, biome, and location of Land Devices is also **random**.

The **current anticipated final number of Land Devices (and thus, land plots) available** in Frogland is 55,000. The map of Frogland is about 60 square kilometers currently ‚Äî but will have ‚Äòresidential‚Äô (privately owned) land, ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô land, public and social areas, areas dedicated to quests, and ‚Äòwilderness‚Äô.

**Land Devices will be released in waves over the next several months and even years.** The release schedule will depend on several factors including demand, market conditions, and community feedback. Froghodlrs will always have right of first refusal for allow list access for future sales ‚Äî one of the many ways we give back to our earliest supporters.
