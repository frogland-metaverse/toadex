# Frog Value Post Land Claim

Many have asked how the Notorious Frogs will retain their value after the land claim. At the root of that question is a concern that some collectors and speculators might have more interest in metaverse land than in the project’s avatars — a reasonable concern for those who are committed to keeping their frogs for the long term to see them accrue value and utility over time.

The Notorious Frog founders are making sure that the ongoing growth of the project will offer perks and benefits to community members who have committed themselves by owning and holding Frogs they know and love.

## The Essence Token

The Frogs have their own type of token emission — _Essence_ — that can only be obtained from a Notorious Frog. The different types of Frog essence are based on the _boost type_ of the Frog. Further, the _level_ of the boost determines the quantity or frequency of the essence __ token emission from that specific Frog.

These emitted _essence_ tokens — in addition to any tokens emitted by the land — will be usable to craft in-game items. An important detail is that the essences themselves are NOT craftable. _This means certain items will only be possible to generate via crafting that requires tokens which are obtainable only from a Frog._

Essence __ is available either by owning and gathering the essence from your own frog, _or,_ if you are frogless, Essence can be traded or purchased from a Froghodlr. Land alone or a non-Frog avatar occupying land will not have access to items that require Frog ownership.

## Permits Can Only Be Obtained & Used By A Frog

For anyone looking to maximize their token gain, owning a Notorious Frog in addition to the Land offers statistical advantage, because the MAX token harvest from land can only happen if a Notorious Frog’s interaction with the land is factored in. In other words, maximal benefit from the land requires both having a Frog occupant and “working” that land. However, it’s also true that the statistical resource advantage from being a Frog doesn’t guarantee that a frogless holder is excluded from having stats that might give them a very high yield. Superior gain is less likely but not impossible for a land deed held by the frogless.

Players who do not own a Frog would need to either trade or purchase improved land from a Frog who had already improved their land. Another potential option for a frogless landholder would be to rent a Frog from another player to obtain a Permit for improvement, thus creating another income stream for Froghodlrs. Basically: Frogs are needed to maximize land value. This arrangement gives Frogs more utility.
