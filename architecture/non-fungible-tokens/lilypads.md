The Land plots will have their own sets of traits, stats, and rarity. A plot of land can be on one of several biomes, such as coastal, tropical, wetland, mountains, forest, desert, and urban. The land‚Äôs biome type implies a dominant resource based on the ecology of its biome, but resources from other biomes may also be present.

The resources of each plot of Land determine the tokens that land will generate. Further, seasonal changes re-roll those resources per season in a way that utilizes randomness but that is based upon the land‚Äôs biome, and based upon the land‚Äôs detailed traits, stats, and rarity.

For any given season, the resources for each land plot is fixed and finite. Meaning: during any given season a land plot‚Äôs resources can be depleted if fully harvested. In such a case the land holder would have to wait for the next season, when the re-roll of resource allocation will determine the abundance available to be harvested as tokens during that new season. Alternatively, a Frog could interact with the Planning Commission mid-season to move to another plot of land that has not been depleted of its resources.

...owning a Notorious Frog in addition to the Land offers statistical advantage, because the MAX token harvest from land can only happen if a Notorious Frog‚Äôs interaction with the land is factored in. In other words, maximal benefit from the land requires both having a Frog occupant and ‚Äúworking‚Äù that land. However, it‚Äôs also true that the statistical resource advantage from being a Frog doesn‚Äôt guarantee that a frogless holder is excluded from having stats that might give them a very high yield. Superior gain is less likely but not impossible for a land device held by the frogless.
