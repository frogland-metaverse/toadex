# üê∏ Frog Team Safety Assurances

We will **NEVER** have a surprise mint.&#x20;

We will **NEVER** do a "limited time" giveaway.&#x20;

There will **NEVER** be a surprise anything 'risky' (connect wallet, click link, claim prize, etc).&#x20;

There will **NEVER** be a 'first X number to claim' promotion.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**IF IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT PROBABLY IS.** Especially if there is pressure being applied to 'hurry and claim', or do it 'before it runs out', it is NOT the Frog Team, and likely a scam.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If we ARE doing a giveaway or a surprise, **THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY RUSH/TIMELINE** to claim.

If we ARE doing a limited run of an item or event, **THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF PRIOR CONFIRMATIONS, AND PLENTY OF TIME TO CONFIRM AGAIN.**

{% hint style="success" %}
If we ARE doing something that seems too good to be true, **WE WILL NEVER FAULT OR PENALIZE YOU FOR CONFIRMING YOU/YOUR ASSETS' SAFETY AND SECURITY.** Taking the time to ask another member of the Frog Team or Mod Squad, verifying via a different communication channel, or even sleeping on it to make sure you feel comfortable is NEVER something that will cause you to lose or miss out.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Double or triple confirming your safety **IS ALWAYS ENCOURAGED.** If you're being pressured to NOT double or triple check, it's not a member of the team and is likely a scam.&#x20;
