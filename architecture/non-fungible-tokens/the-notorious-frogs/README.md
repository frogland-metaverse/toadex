# The Notorious Frogs

## What Does It All Mean?&#x20;

When we started this project, we wanted more than just a series of profile pictures, or even a series of avatars. We wanted to trigger imaginations, jumpstart dreams, and inspire magic with the 10,000 main characters that are the Notorious Frogs.

But we didn’t want to be too prescriptive or limiting with each Frog. Each Froghodlr should be able to find a frog that speaks to them, one who represents who they are, who they want to be — or just who they want to play. We needed to create 10,000 characters with enough color and unique flavor to inspire that connection, but still leave enough room on the canvas for creation.&#x20;

All traits of the Frogs — visuals, levels, boosts, and affiliations — have reason and utility more than skin deep. They are meant to act as a baseline, your first “last saved location” in game. Each individual trait will make that frog suited for one thing — or several — better than another, and Frogs with higher baseline stats will have an easier place to start from.

But nothing is forever — even immortal Frogs. You can choose a different path than your Frog’s affiliation. You can improve your skills, or potentially lose them. You can utilize your natural talents, or put in the time to master something different. You can be whoever you want to be — but if you’d like a suggestion, see what your Frog thinks.

As we continue to build in the open, we welcome feedback and critique from our community. Our objective is to build a social and gamified world that forms the basis for strange adventures — a world that is fun and sustainable, and, as has always been true, to co-create the Notorious Frogland Experience with __ our community’s talent and feedback.
