# Syndicate Bribes For The Planning Commission

The Planning Commission has one predictable pattern: it will give [Syndicates](../../../frogland/organizations/syndicates.md) and Syndicate members priority in exchange for bribes. This means your chances of getting what you want from a Planning Commission improves if you are not a singleton, but a member of a group.

Bribes are competitive. More money is more attractive to a bribable entity or character MOST times, but other factors can affect which bribes a Planning Commission may accept. **What the Forest Planning Commission may think is a valuable bribe might not match with what the Desert Planning Commission might desire,** and this should be taken into account when determining the bribe type, amount, and specificity of tokens offered.&#x20;

When a bribe is accepted by a Planning Commission, you will jump the queue - if declined, your bribe will be returned, and youâ€™ll have to wait in line, remove your belt and your shoes, and make sure to separate your laptop from your carryon.
