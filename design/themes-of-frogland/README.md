# üåê Themes of Frogland

Using the pillars of NewPangea, we prompted our community for ideas and feedback to create overarching themes based around what drew them to the Notorious Frogs and the story they told. The creation spawned from such is nothing short of amazing, and we endeavor every day to fulfill these ideals and build Frogland into the fantastical, challenging, lush, edgy, authentic place that every Notorious Frog hodlr feels they can call home.
