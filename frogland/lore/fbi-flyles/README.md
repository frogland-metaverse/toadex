# 🗄 FBI Flyles

The lack of any desire to police or abide by any laws have made these 10,000 frogs a relatively lawless bunch, though many Frogs try to live up to the positive connotation of “notorious” rather than the negative. The FLPD is pretty useless, being more interested in catching flies than criminals. The Frogland Bureau of Instigations (FBI) is more intent on solving crimes and taking bribes…provided they’re sizable enough.&#x20;

Herein you will find public record of some of the most notorious of all Notorious Frogs: their Rap Sheets, Wanted posters, and more!
