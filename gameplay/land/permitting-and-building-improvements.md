# Permitting and Building Improvements

When a Frog applies to the appropriate [Planning Commission](the-planning-commission/what-is-the-planning-commission.md) to improve or build on their land, the Commission’s approval allows the landowner to [extract more resources](../../architecture/non-fungible-tokens/lilypads.md) — tokens — from a particular lilyPAD. While applying for and receiving a [permit](../../architecture/non-fungible-tokens/permits.md) will allow for [improved resource harvesting](permitting-and-building-improvements.md) through a Frog (and only a Frog) building such devices on their land, there are still several other considerations to be aware of.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For instance, the rules that apply to occupancy and permitting are slightly different in each biome, thus the need for a different office of the Planning Commission for each.
{% endhint %}

The resources available to be extracted are dependent on several things: the type and amount of total resources at that lilyPAD, which is partially determined by the biome of that plot; the rarity and traits of the Land Device attached to that lilyPAD; and the resource extraction permit. Permits have a cost to obtain and are temporary, lasting only for one season, whereas an occupant may choose to retain control of a lilyPAD for as long as they like, or until they make an occupancy application to take control of a new, unoccupied lilyPAD.
