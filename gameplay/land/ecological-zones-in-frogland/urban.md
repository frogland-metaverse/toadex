# üè® Urban

The Urban biome might be the one everyone anticipated either to choose, or to live in, or perhaps what's "safest"...whether or not the concrete jungle is safer than the real jungle is yet to be determined. If the other biomes show off the beautiful side of Frogland, the urban biome shows off the surreal. A strange dichotomy of the familiar and the alien is shown in the urban biome. The newer art deco structures built by the frogs contrast in a surreal way against the ultra-modern brutalist structures left by whatever alien race that resided (or still resides) here.

More info coming soon...
