# ðŸ˜Ž Gangs

Gangs make up the social layer of gameplay. At any point, any Froghodlr can hop into the discord and ping Lollihops or a mod to start their own gang, complete with a private chat room and role. Similarly, joining a gang is pretty easy â€” some gangs have requirements or an initiation ritual to join, but typically itâ€™s more of a matter of asking than anything else. [The Toadex](https://frogland.gitbook.io/toadex/frogland/organizations/gangs) has a continually updating list of gangs with their public lore and information to explore. Gangs can be formed around anything: the traits of the frogs, boosts or clothing, or something more abstract; a shared goal or interest, even friendship â€” or a common enemy. No matter how they start, the gangs play an important role in community building.

The formation of a gang begins the process of both individual and group story and character creation. By working with others for a similar goal, idea, or connection, they develop an influential piece in the Frogland puzzle. As we discussed in [A Frog of a Different Ribbit](https://frogland.medium.com/a-frog-of-a-different-ribbit-4561235171be), co-creation is not something that flourishes in a small, dark room with limited brains involved. Being able to work together to utilize each otherâ€™s unique skills and ideas, a small spark of an idea can form into a clutch of eggs, ready to be hatched into the world.

Once a gang has a solid foundation of members, goals and backstory, they are invited into the frog role playing game (FRPG). The FRPG helps expand their lore, characters, and problem solving in a fun and lighthearted setting, further encouraging co-creation. Presenting a newly formed team with a challenge to overcome helps develop the identity of the gang and the individual characters, giving them more depth of experience and character. Galvanizing a gang adds depth, collaboration, and relationship building to a nascent idea, helping it grow from spawn to tadpole.

Gangs do not _need_ to progress past this point â€” as with everything in Frogland, it is up to the user to determine the level of involvement they wish to have with either the game or the development. However, if they wish to do more, forming a syndicate is the next hop.

Gang and syndicate memberships are not mutually exclusive or inclusive. Users can join as many gangs as they would like, or none. Being a member of one gang does not mean that you have to be a member of that syndicate, or preclude you from supporting another syndicate.
