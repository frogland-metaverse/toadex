# ðŸŒµ Desert

Frogs are notoriously..._moist_...creatures - however, there are some areas in Frogland where moisture is not as readily available as, say, the Wetlands. The Desert may not be a biome you'd think of as the most desirable place to live in Frogland, but I would not be so quick to judge. These arid climates are full of strange creatures who have adapted to survive the more harsh climate, as well as plants who may not always be quite what they seem. This climate may make living more tough, but for those ready to stick it out and dig deep...the rewards may surprise you...
