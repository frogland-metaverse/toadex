#### Interactions Between Frogs, LSDs, and their LilyPADs

The relationship between a Land Synthesis Device (LSD) and a Plot of Land is different from the relationship between a Notorious Frog and a LSD. When a Land Device is assigned to a specific Plot of Land, the Plot of Land and the Device NFT become linked and will travel together when sold â€” however not necessarily forever because it will be possible to _reassign_ a Device a _different_ plot of land by interacting with the appropriate _Planning Commission_.
