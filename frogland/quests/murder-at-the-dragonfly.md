# ðŸ¦‹ Murder at the Dragonfly

During the gathering of Eth addresses for the waves of pre-sale spot allocations for the Notorious Frogs mint, we asked community members to fill out their frog name, 'Past Notorious Deeds', and 'Future Notorious Plans', as well as any 'Known Accomplices'. This allowed the Frog Team to sift through a glut of original content and ideas directly from the beginning and select thirty candidates to play roles in the very first **F**rog **R**ole **P**laying **G**ame. These thirty frogs were interviewed and offered different roles within the game, ranging from the 'Top Ten Most Wanted' frogs, different media reporters, a private eye, investigators, a psychic, and a spiritualist.&#x20;

Once each participant had accepted a role they felt would suit their froggy character, we kicked off the murder mystery with a news bulletin from three separate news sources in Frogland...

### **...The Daily Splat,** a sensationalist tabloid...

### ...The Morning Reflections, a broadsheet snooty paper...
