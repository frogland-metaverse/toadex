A renowned fine artist inspired by the trips to the pond with her father, spawned this amazing project to make the frogs live forever. Having spent the last 12 years between London and Bermuda looking for what is beyond abstraction, Frogzilla discovered that generative art is the next evolution in the art world. Having sold artwork at the prestigious Lots Road Auction House in Central London, Frogzilla has no backlog of unsold art. Traditional art has never felt near as personal nor exciting as creating art for the NFT space. Having been mentored and certified from the Museum of Modern Art, Frogzilla learned a valuable lesson of staying true to herself so that anyone can see it in the originality of her work.

### Gamabunta, CToF (Chief Tokenomic Frog)

Coming from a work background dealing in the importance of human connection and communication through more than just spoken word, Lollihops made the leap into full time crypto and NFTs shortly after the launch of Frogland. Fondly known as the Chief Cat Herder, she is the touch point between all internal and external branches of the project, including the members of the community, partner projects, and game dev studio. She ensures the fluid blending of community vision with creative and narrative direction in the testbed of the discord, then integrated into the gameplay and aesthetic of the metaverse.
