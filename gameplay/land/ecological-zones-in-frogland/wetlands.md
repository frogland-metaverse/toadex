As frogs, the wetlands can present in a few different ways - swamps, ponds, bogs, marshes all come to mind. There had been interest in having a lilyPAD where a frog could live happily, floating above the water... That is some of what we intended to capture here. While the water may look peaceful from above, it's worth wondering what may lurk below...

More info coming soon...
