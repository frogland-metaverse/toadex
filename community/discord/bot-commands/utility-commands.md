# Utility Commands

There are some bots and bot commands that are purely utility driven and there to help.&#x20;

### Translator Bot

#### **/translate:** \[What you want to say goes here] **to:** \[choice of language]

This is a massively helpful tool for communicating with those outside of your native language. While we do have at least one mod that speaks at least one of the languages in our International Frogs section, this tool is massively helpful all the way around.&#x20;

#### Emoji Flag Reactions to Messages

If you would like to request a translation into a different language, react to the message with the flag of the country who's language you wold like the message translated into. The bot will translate and reply to you in the same channel for ease of communication.&#x20;

### Music Bots

#### Too Many Zooz DJ (Tempo)

This bot is playing Too Many Zooz 24/7 in the **#Zooz-Main-Stage** voice channel, representing the full licensing use that Too Many Zooz gave to us for use in Frogland. There is an interactive button panel in the text channel **#Zooz-Bar** where you can see what's playing, skip, or go back in the playlist.&#x20;

#### Frogland Bot

This bot can be used in the **#Speakeasy**, **#Lilypad-Lounge**, or any other voice channels except for **#Zooz-Main-Stage.** To interact with the bot, join a voice channel, then use the commands listed below.&#x20;

**$play \[song, artist, album, or URL]** - plays a song if nothing is on, otherwise adds to the queue

**$radio \[station name]** - stream a radio station

**$pause** - pauses the music

**$stop** - stops the music and the bot will exit the channel

**$skip** - skips to the next song

**$loop** - adds the songs back to the queue when finished

**$queue** - view songs in the queue

**$shuffle** - shuffles the queue

**$autoplay** - will play similar songs once the queue is over

**$clear queue** - clears all songs from the queue
