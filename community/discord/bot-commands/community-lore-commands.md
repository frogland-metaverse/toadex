# Community Lore Commands

<details>

<summary>$buy daily</summary>

This will purchase the latest edition of [the-daily-splat.md](../../../frogland-news-network-fnn/the-daily-splat.md "mention") in discord for 50 Frogdollars. When followed by the **$use daily** command, you will receive an image of the latest edition of The Daily Splat to catch up on the most sensational news, hottest gossip, wanted posters, and much more - all sourced from the community!

<summary>$buy boombox</summary>

This will purchase a boombox in discord for 75 frogdollars where you can listen to [khop-radio](../../../frogland-news-network-fnn/khop-radio/ "mention") news, when followed by the **$use boombox** command. Problem is that it's a little old and busted, and is stuck playing a news bulletin on loop covering the story of Jimmy 'The Knee' Grenouille's murder. I wonder if there's someone else with access to sound equipment in Frogland...

<summary>$wanted</summary>

This command will retrieve the most recent "Most Wanted" poster from the Frogland Bureau of Instigations. If you would like to report somefrog for misdeeds, hop on over to the #message-board channel and submit an Hit Request or Anonymous Tip for the Daily Splat. Our investigative reporters hardly ever deal underhandedly and will find the kernel of truth to the story.&#x20;
