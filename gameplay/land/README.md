# üèù Land

We recognize that explanations of this material can be complex and dense. As the technical details become inseparable from the buildout of the world, we‚Äôre writing this and future informational articles to be as clearly described as possible. We also will be as transparent as possible, so it‚Äôs essential we acknowledge that the core foundational code and related interactive experiences are under intense and active development. That means as we explain the design while building the world it will construct, some details may need to change as the layers are established, implemented, and tested. As always, our commitment is to design Frogland as experiences that are playable, fun, filled with compelling mysteries and answers, and that is sustainable over the long term as time and space expand forward, outward, and inward.\

There are several different types of land in NewPangea. The world is full of vibrant scenes, vistas, ecosystems, and climates. Each area is different but there are some core concepts that are applicable to all areas.

### Public Land

Public land is space available to anyone and everyone. Examples of public land include streets, shops, establishments, and quest areas that are accessible to all players. Most quests start and end at public points of interest.

### Community Upgradeable Land

Some land in NewPangea can be operated and upgraded by the community. These lands are accessible to everyone but can be customized by players in certain circumstances.

### Private Land

Private land is owned by players and can be customized. Private land takes many shapes and sizes and is spread throughout all of NewPangea's different ecosystems. Some private land can be modified externally while some land can only be modified internally.

### Quest Areas

Certain areas are accessible only as part of a quest line.

### Restricted Areas

Certain areas are restricted for access by certain character types or for certain levels.
